sms32v23 for Windows95/98/NT
============================


1. The program's purpose
========================

An x86 Microprocessor Simulator for students of low level 
programming written for Windows95/98/NT.

The simulator is based on the low eight bits of the 8086 chip.  
It can be single stepped or continuously run.  The CPU registers, 
and RAM contents are made visible.

The simulator is programmed x86 like assembly code.  The machine 
code generated is not the same as 8086 code.

You can control simulated traffic lights, seven segment 
displays, a heater and thermostat, a stepper motor, a
lift and a snake in a maze.  CALL, RET, INT, AND IRET are 
available in the registered version.  

Serious programming problems like multiplexing, procedures, 
parameter passing, interrupts and recursion can be tackled.

There is on-line help stored in a Windows Help file.  The help
pages can be word processed and printed.  There is a MS Word 2 
version of the on line help.

This upgrade from V2.2 fixes bugs and irons out some problems in 
the user interface.

2. How to install
=================

Create a folder for the software.  

Unzip the distributed file into this folder.

Run the simulator by double clicking Sms32V23.Exe.

Create shortcuts to the program if you wish.

It is recommended that students are not given all the example 
files.  Students should be given all the numbered examples such as 
02tlight.asm and 99snake.asm.  They should also have Demo.asm.  

Teachers can use the other examples as they wish.  Many examples
are solutions to the student exercises.


Network Installation - On a network, the program should be 
installed in a read only directory and run from a directory with 
write permission for the user.  User preferences are saved in 
the student's working directory in Sms32V23.INI.  The program 
looks for help and user registration files in the program's 
exe file directory.  The shareware version has no user registration 
file.  If Sms32V23.INI does not exist, it will be created 
with default values.


3. This Program is Shareware
============================

Educational institutions are encouraged to register.  Students may 
use the registered or un-registered software free of charge.  The 
registered version is unlocked by purchasing a software key.  If 
you have a key for a previous version, it should work with this 
version also.

Students should, whenever possible, obtain the registered version 
from their school, college or university.  Registered sites have 
permission to run unlimited instances of the program on their site.  
They may also print and photocopy any of the documentation.

As an encouragement to register, four extra machine instructions are 
available in the registered version.  Complete beginners do not need 
these instructions but serious low level programmers do.  The bonus 
instructions are CALL, RET, INT and IRET.  A simulated hardware 
timer interrupt is also available in the registered version.


4. The program is freely distributable
======================================

The complete unmodified shareware file set may be distributed freely.
Re-packaging for different media is permitted.


5. How to contact the author in case of questions or problems
